##  Discrete Structures and their Applications - Python

This is the folder for CS220 (Discrete Structures and their Applications) at Colorado State University.

Integer representations and properties, propositions, predicates, sets, functions, program proofs, induction, counting, complexity; Python implementations of these concepts. Provides the mathematical background required for a deep understanding of computer science concepts. We will demonstrate the relevance of the mathematical concepts using Python, an easy to learn, widely used programming language.
